# Migrate your WordPress app 

## Basics

You can migrate your WordPress app to Windows or Linux App Service web apps. Migrations strategy can be done either by :
1. Using a plugin to export and import your web app 
2. Manual migrations of files and database 

For mission-critical Wordpress applications, I recommend using manual migration strategy due to complexities involved in your application needs. 
For smaller sites , your can use plugins such as [All-in-one WP migration](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/) and many other plugins available in Wordpress plugin repository. 

## Manual Migration 

Most apps are manually migrated and it is more safer to do a manual migration , hence this document focuses only on manual migration. Before you start the migration process , backup your entire site and database from your current infrastructure. 

### Create a empty web app 

### Create a MySQL database 

### Edit wp-config.php to point to new database

### Deploy Wordpress files to web app

### Import database to Azure MySQL database 

### Update URLs in Wordpress database in Azure 

### Add custom domain
